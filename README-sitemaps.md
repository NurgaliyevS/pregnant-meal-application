# Pregnancy Week Pages SEO Guide

This guide explains how to manage and submit the pregnancy week pages (1-42 weeks) to search engines for better SEO.

## Structure

The pregnancy week pages follow this URL pattern:
```
https://pregnantmeal.com/pregnancy/[number]-weeks-pregnant-in-months
```

Where `[number]` ranges from 1 to 42.

We have created the following sitemap files:

1. `public/sitemap-0.xml` - Contains all the blog and other pages
2. `public/sitemap-pregnancy.xml` - Contains all 42 pregnancy week pages
